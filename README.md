DEPRECATED
==========

**This repository has been replaced with [ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-window-wayland](https://github.com/activitywatch/aw-watcher-window-wayland)**

A prototype window+afk watcher for the sway window manager.

Not as reliable as aw-watcher-window+aw-watcher-afk but it works on Wayland

As there is no way to get input in wayland afk detection does not work, it simply assumes that you are never afk
